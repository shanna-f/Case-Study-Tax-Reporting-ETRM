## 📍 Part 1: Problem Statement & Current State Analysis

For this case study (fictional, for portfolio purposes), I imagined working with a large oil & gas products trading company struggling with **indirect tax reporting** in their **Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) system**.

### ⚠️ Key Challenges
- Manual data handling across modules  
- Error-prone workflows and delays  
- Siloed data not built for tax reporting  
- Constantly changing tax regulations  
- High audit and compliance risk  
- Limited scalability, SME-dependent  

### 🔹 Current State Highlights
A high-level process flow revealed heavy reliance on:  
- Manual ETRM data extraction  
- Spreadsheet-based tax calculations  
- Rule updates managed by just a few SMEs  
- Manual report generation  

This created major risks of delays, errors, inconsistent tax application, and costly compliance gaps.

> 👉 As a BA, I recognized that defining the problem well is half the battle. The problem statement and current state analysis set the foundation for project goals, solution options, and requirements.

## 🎯 Part 2: Goals Alignment & Success Measures  

With the problems clearly defined, I moved into setting goals, alignment, and success metrics. This step ensured the project had both operational and strategic value.

### 🎯 Key Goals

1. Automatically extract and consolidate **90% of tax-relevant data** into centralized reports, reducing manual prep time from 2 days to under 2 hours per month within 3 months.
2. Enforce **100% validation rules** for tax-relevant fields at time of trade or shipment entry, targeting a 50% reduction in rework due to data issues within 3 months.
3. Align **100% of master data** used in tax logic across trade and logistics modules, with a quarterly governance review process in place within 3 months.
4. Implement a **rules engine** allowing tax analysts to update 80% of logic without IT, cutting change turnaround time from 2 weeks to 2 days, within 2 months.
5. Ensure that **100% of tax rule changes and override actions** are logged with user-level traceability and available for export on demand, within 2 months.

### 🚀 Strategic Alignment
- **Efficiency:** Automate manual reporting  
- **Compliance:** Standardize & track audits  
- **Agility:** Let users manage tax rules  
- **Data Integrity:** Align master data  
- **Responsiveness:** Validate in real time  

### 📊 Sample KPIs
- Prep time reduced from 16 to <2 hours/month  
- 90%+ reports auto-generated  
- 50% fewer errors in tax reports  
- 100% validation of tax-relevant fields  
- 100% audit traceability  
- 80% of rule changes completed without IT  

> 👉 Defining clear KPIs and alignment gave this project accountability and purpose.
